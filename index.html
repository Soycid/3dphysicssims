<p class="introduction" lang="en">
Hello there! This website hosts a few 3D concept projects. They were all originally in cpp and opengl however I ported some to threejs if they didn't use too many models. These also work on mobile, so have fun!
</p>
<p>
<i> IMPORTANT: To view the simulations, you need to use either a trackpad, a mouse or a touch screen. Using gestures on a trackpad, a mouse wheel + right-click or a touch screen you can move around the 3D view. Use the sliders to alter parameters.</i>

<h2 lang="en">Theory of Simulations</h2>
	<p>Almost all the simulations utilize <i>Numerical Methods</i>, which are algorithms that are able to generate motion from physical equations and initial conditions. The specific ones used in these simulations are the Runge-Kutta Method and the Verlet Velocity method.  </p>
	<p> Source code for the Numerical methods can be found <a href="https://github.com/Soycid/soycid.github.io"> here</a>, however I got most of my ideas for ODE simulation from  <i> Elementary Differential Equations And Boundary Value Problems </i>. The computations done by the numerical methods are all done client-side through JavaScript and graphically represented using the WebGL-based ThreeJs graphics library. </p>

<h2 lang="en">Descriptions</h2>
<h1 lang="en">Three Body Problem</h1>
	<p> The three body problem is quite famous in celestial mechanics, as it is impossible to solve without relying on numerical methods. This problem as come up particularly when trying to model the system of the Earth, Sun and Moon. </p>
	<p> Modeling the orbit of three celestial bodies requires one to use a numerical method to model the equations of motion. In this case, <i> symplectic euler </i> was used to solve the following equations: </p>

	<p>The simulation also traces the path of the planets. In my opinion, the shapes are quite aesthetic, so have fun playing with the sliders! </p>
<h1 lang="en">Single Oscillating Spring</h1>
	<p>The equation for a Hookean spring is:</p>
	&emsp; <b> F = - kx </b>
	<p> Using Newton's second law, we can re-write this expression as a second order ODE</p>
	&emsp; <b> x'' = -k/m x </b>
	<p> The simulation is a visualization of this equation. I also added the ability to dampen, making it more akin to a real spring</p>

<h1 lang="en">Single Pendulum</h1>
	<p> Like the Hookean spring, the simple pendulum can be described as a <i> simple harmonic oscillator </i>, however this is only true for small angles. The equation for the motion of a pendulum is as follows: </p>
	&emsp; <b> θ'' = − g⁄R sin θ </b>
	<p> This can be solved iteratively using the same methods as the oscillating spring. </p>
